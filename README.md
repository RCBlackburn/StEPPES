# StEPPES: Spatiotemporal Evaluation of Pastoral Patterns and Ecological Sustainability

Welcome to the StEPPES repository! This project is dedicated to hosting and sharing data related to the spatiotemporal evaluation of pastoral patterns and ecological sustainability. Here you will find datasets, reports, and resources to support research and decision making. 


## Data Access

All data layers and code is avilable on figeshare (https://doi.org/10.25573/data.29867561.v1)

The SteppePY App provides interactive tools and visualizations for exploring the vegetation data layers produced during this procject. Use the app to analyze trends, generate reports, and gain insights into the ecological dynamics of the steppe ecosystems across the aimags Dundgovi, Govisümber, and Töv.
